# 🎓 Student Management System

A full-stack web application designed to manage student records, built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend. This project allows users to add, view, edit, and delete student data through a user-friendly interface.

---

## 📌 Project Aim

To build a web-based system that helps institutions manage student records efficiently—digitally replacing traditional paper-based systems. Users can easily:

- Add new student entries
- View a list of students
- Edit or update existing records
- Delete outdated records

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create an intuitive and responsive UI for managing student data
- Understand interaction between frontend and backend in a real-world app
- Perform CRUD operations with MongoDB using Node.js
- Build a complete full-stack web app using modern web technologies
- Improve logical thinking and real-world problem-solving skills
- Provide a practical project for academic use or portfolio

## 💻 Technologies Used

| Layer      | Technology           |
|------------|----------------------|
| Frontend   | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Backend    | Node.js, Express.js  |
| Database   | MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas |
| Libraries  | Mongoose, CORS       |

## 🧩 Features

- 📄 Add, edit, delete student data
- 🔍 Search student records by name
- 💾 Persistent data storage using MongoDB
- ☁️ Cloud-hosted database via MongoDB Atlas
- ⚙️ RESTful API structure
- 🔐 Cross-origin requests handled via CORS middleware

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Frontend (students.html)**
- Form to enter student details: Name, Grade, Email, Phone, DOB, Classroom
- Displays student data in dynamic cards
- Includes edit & delete options, and a search bar

### 2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
- REST API routes for all CRUD operations:
  - `GET /students`
  - `POST /students`
  - `PUT /students/:id`
  - `DELETE /students/:id`

### 3. **Database (MongoDB + Mongoose)**
- Student data stored in schema-less documents
- Managed using Mongoose for structure and easy querying

## 📦 Dependencies

- **Express** – Backend routing & API handling
- **Mongoose** – MongoDB integration and data modeling
- **CORS** – Handling frontend-backend communication
- **MongoDB Atlas** – Cloud database hosting
